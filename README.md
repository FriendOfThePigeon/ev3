EV3 Programs
============

line-follower 
-------------

Follow a blue line. Follows the line, not the boundary of the line.

The build-in reflected intensity measurement of the color sensor uses the red LED, and therefore is almost totally useless for following a blue line. You can use the raw RGB readings instead.
